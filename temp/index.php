									Of all the relationships that are an integral part of your life, none has more far reaching effects
									 than those of your family. Divorce, child custody and visitation, domestic violence and questions

								<p><strong>MEDIATION</strong></p>
				          		<br />Mediation is another form of alternative dispute resolution.
                                                    Mediation usually lasts one day and includes a neutral third party, a &quot;mediator,&quot;

                                                    who assists the parties in coming to a resolution usually by sending offers of settlement
                                                    back and forth between the parties.
                                                    <br />
                                                    <br />
                                                    Our firm offers two distinct options for mediation. First, we can assist our clients
                                                    in setting up a mediation with the other party and his or her lawyer. Second, Retired
                                                    Judge Kevin Carey is a mediator as well as an attorney and often assists parties
                                                    in his capacity as a mediator to facilitate agreements</span>.<br />
